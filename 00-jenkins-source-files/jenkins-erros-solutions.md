git@github.com:username/repo.git HEAD" returned status code 128:
stdout:
stderr: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Solution:
This error indicates that Jenkins doesn't have the necessary permissions to access the Git repository. To resolve it:

    🔑 Configure SSH Key:
            Ensure that Jenkins has the correct SSH key configured to access the Git repository. You may need to generate an SSH key specifically for the Jenkins user and add it to your Git hosting service.

    🛡️ Verify Credentials:
            Verify that the SSH key has been added to the correct Jenkins credential store and is being used by the job.

    🌐 Check Repository Settings:
            Double-check the repository URL and credentials configured in the Jenkins job settings.

Error 4: "No Space Left on Device" in Jenkins
Issue:
Jenkins encounters "No space left on device" when trying to write to disk.
Example:

hudson.util.IOException2: java.io.IOException: No space left on
device

Solution:
This error indicates that the disk where Jenkins is trying to write doesn't have enough free space. To resolve it:

    📊 Check Disk Space:
            Check the disk space on the server where Jenkins is installed. You can use commands like df -h to check disk usage.

    🗑️ Clean Up Old Builds:
            Clean up unnecessary files or old builds from Jenkins to free up disk space.

    💾 Consider Disk Resizing:
            Consider resizing or adding additional disk space to the server if this becomes a recurring issue.

Error 5: "Build Failed with an Exception" in Jenkins
Issue:
The build failed with a generic exception message without specific details.
Example:
